                    <h4>New Testament</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      The New Testament is a collection of writings composed in the second half of the 1st century through the beginning of the 2nd century CE. Composed in Koine Greek, these texts include stories about Jesus of Nazareth and letters circulated among early Christian communities.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      There's a whole bunch of stuff I could write about the New Testament, but instead I have used this page
                      to give a brief overview of the dating and authorship of the texts contained within.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      According to virtually all modern scholarship, of the canonical gospels, Mark is considered to be the earliest, with Matthew and Luke using it as a source, probably independently from one another. The latter two also most likely share a no-longer-extant common source. For more on this, <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoptic_Gospels">click here</a>. Oh and also, John is considered to be the last of the four to be written.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As to these and the other texts, and all things NT, you can consult various resources, I've linked a blog I follow at the bottom of the page!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="box-o-text">
                  <p> Right, so the below chart gives you a rough idea of when the different texts were written.</p>
                  <p> I've color-coded the books by type: <br><a class="btn btn-primary btn-book btn-cat-1-a btn-cat-2-x" role=button>narrative form</a> - gospels and acts,
                    <br><a class="btn btn-primary btn-book btn-cat-1-c btn-cat-2-x" role=button>letter form</a> - epistles, and an
                    <br><a class="btn btn-primary btn-book btn-cat-1-d btn-cat-2-x" role=button>apocalypse genre</a> writing.</p>
                    <p>
                      I've further color-coded the borders by authorship type:</p>

                        <ul><li>a <strong>black</strong> border signifies a text where the author has directly identified himself, and scholars believe that the text was genuinely written by this person.</li></ul>
                        This category includes the seven undisputed letters of Paul, and Revelation, the author of which identifies himself as John - this would not have been the same John to whom tradition attributes the text, but neither does the author claim to be the apostle, so this is not considered a forgery.

                    <br><br>
                      <ul><li>a <strong style="color: red">red</strong> border means the text is pseudepigraphic, that is, the supposed authorship is not considered genuine</li></ul>
                      This category includes the forged and most-likely-forged letters of Paul as well as other pseudepigraphic epistles. The epistles of John tend not to be considered pseudepigraphic but rather anonymous. However, <a href="https://www.hugomendez.com/publications/did-the-johannine-community-exist/">some scholars</a>
                      argue that the author or authors of these texts do (falsely) imply authorship of the Gospel of John and, even more, that these are texts written to look like epistles written by the same author to a community, but are not. This is not however the consensus view, so I've marked them as anonymous instead.


                    <br><br>
                      <ul><li>as signified by the <strong style="color:green">green</strong> border, the gospels and acts, for instance, are anonymous writings, although Luke and Acts are thought to have been written by the same author.
                      </li></ul>
                      Again there are complexities, for instance, the author of Luke-Acts seems to (almost certainly falsely) imply that they were a companion of Paul, and the author of (at least some of) John likewise seems to imply authority by virtue of either having been there when the events occurred, or having access to such a person.


                    <p>
                      Nevertheless, they are considered anonymous. Their titles were added decades later by other people. Likewise, the Epistle to the Hebrews, traditionally attributed to Paul, makes no such authorship claim in the text.
                    </p>
