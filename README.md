## My first static site!
This static site was created as a homework assignment for CS50x. Since then I have learned a lot more. I have discovered frameworks, I have more properly learned JS, and I have learned much, _much_ better practices in CSS (and HTML, for that matter)

For posterity's sake, I have now added this to my public portfolio!
